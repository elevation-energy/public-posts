## Position Summary
We're looking for a mid-level PHP programmer with Laravel experience to join our team. Salary will depend on experience. The duties performed will mostly be back-end, but some front-end and JavaScript experience is required. Our small development team is in the process of finishing a new application the company uses to transmit data to and from utility companies. You will be writing (tested) code for adding features into our new system, as well as helping to migrate utilities from our old system onto the new system. Down the road you will help translate marketing objectives or new business requirements into well crafted applications or tools.

Our new system relies on a handful of well tested private composer packages we have created to keep things decoupled. If you aren't experienced with creating your own composer packages and have limited experience with test-driven development, this will be a great growth opportunity for you. If you are already experienced in these areas, then great, you can push your knowledge even further and be a productive contributor to our team very quickly. We have an established CI/CD workflow and all code will be reviewed and discussed with a senior engineer. You may also be asked to perform code reviews of senior engineers. We are dedicated to building an environment that will expand your knowledge and push you farther in your career as well as produce high quality software the company can depend on.

* You have a solid foundation in MYSQL and can write basic selects, updates, inserts, and joins. You will primarily be using Eloquent for your queries but an understanding of what is going on under the hood goes a long way.
